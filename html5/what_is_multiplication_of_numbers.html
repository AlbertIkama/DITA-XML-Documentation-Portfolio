    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Here you will learn what is multiplication.</p>
        <p class="p">Multiplication is the process of calculating the product of two or more numbers. The
            symbols <strong class="ph b">(×)</strong> and <strong class="ph b">(*)</strong> represent the multiplication operation.
            Multiplication simplifies the task of repeated addition of the same number.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Example:</strong> If there are 10 boxes of cupcakes and each box has 8 cupcakes, find the
            total number of cupcakes.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Solution:</strong> We can solve this question by addition, but it would take longer to add
            these and get the answer. That is, <strong class="ph b"><em class="ph i">10 + 10+ 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80
                    cupcakes</em></strong>. </p>
        <p class="p">For large numbers, this approach can be a challenge. However, multiplication simplifies
            the process, especially when working with large numbers. That is <strong class="ph b"><em class="ph i">10 × 8= 80
                    cupcakes</em></strong>.</p>
